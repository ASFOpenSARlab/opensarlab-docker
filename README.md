This repoository contains paired down versions of docker enviroments found on OpenSARlab. They have been created so users can have a similar experience on their own local machine. 

Note that due to the nature of Docker, users should have a fast internet connection and a local machine with at least 8 GB of RAM. A typical docker image requires downloading 5-8 GB of files during the build process.
