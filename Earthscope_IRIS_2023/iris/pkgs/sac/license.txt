The following license amendment only applies to the IRIS 2022 Workshop and it's attendees. The use of SAC is otherwise bound to the default SAC license as expressed at http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/sac/.

As of this date (25 Aug 2022), the SAC License has been amended by request as follows: 

"This letter grants you allowance to freely access, copy, modify, build, distribute, disclose, 
and use the SAC v102.0 Software (the 'Software') and its derivatives for the purposes of
workshops, instruction, and utility as deemed necessary in your work.
The license terms indicated in the software's License file (as listed below) are considered
NULL AND VOID for the purposes and needs of your work:
1) Section 2a - limited access and use
2) Section 2b - limited access, copies, distribution
3) Section 8 - export control laws
All references to "SAC 2000" and "SAC 2000 VERSION 100" found in the currently
distributed license are to now be regarded simply as 'SAC', recognized as an independent
derivative product created by and maintained by IRIS."
