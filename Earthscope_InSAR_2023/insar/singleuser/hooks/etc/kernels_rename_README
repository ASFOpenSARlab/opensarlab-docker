The $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels has been renamed to $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels_old.

This was done to avoid conflicting kernel.json files, which can break the kernels.

If you wish to revert this change, you are free to do so.

There is a flag file at the path: $HOME/.jupyter/old_kernels_flag.txt

Renaming of the directory occurs at OpenSARlab server startup only if the flag file does not exist.

If you would like to restore your $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels directory, rename it but leave the flag file untouched:
mv $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels_old $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels

The $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels directory will not be renamed again unless the flag file is deleted.
