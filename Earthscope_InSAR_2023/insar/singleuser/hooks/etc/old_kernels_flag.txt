This file is a flag. Its existence indicates that the $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels has
been renamed to $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels_old.

This was done to avoid conflicting kernel.json files

This renaming occurs at OpenSARlab server startup only if this file does not exist at the path:
$HOME/.jupyter/old_kernels_flag.txt

If you would like to restore your $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels directory, rename it but leave this file untouched:
mv $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels_old $HOME/.local/share/jupyter/kernels

It will not be renamed again unless this file is deleted.
