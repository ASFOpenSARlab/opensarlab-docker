# Building the GEOS627 Image and Running it in a Docker Container

**Note: M1 Macs are not currently supported.**

## For Windows User:
---
Running Docker is easier if you were to use WSL2, which is a paired down version of Linux running on Windows 10+.

- [WSL2 Installation Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
    - Install the terminal as described in the final optional step on the page linked above

**Important Notes for Windows User**:

### Use Linux Space to Run Docker
As of now, Windows implementation will **only work if you were to run them on Linux side** of WSL 2. 

To switch to a Linux side, you may run the following command on your WSL 2:
```bash
cd ~/
```

Refer to below example image to check if you are in Linux side:
![WSL Linux Side](img/wsl_linux.PNG)


Below example is what it would look like if you're in Windows side of WSL (i.e. will not work if your terminal looks like this):

![WSL Windows Side](img/wsl_windows.PNG)

If you cloned this repo on Windows side, you can move this entire directory to Linux side using following command:

``` bash
mv -v <path_to_opensarlab-docker>/opensarlab-docker ~/
```

### Resource Usage
Running WSL2 and Docker may occasionally consume lot of resources. This can slow down your computer and sometimes crash programs that you are currently running (e.g. Google Chrome). If you are having issue with absurd memory consumption, you may need to set a consumption limit for your WSL2. 

Here are some ways that you can limit your memory consumption by WSL2:

- Press <kbd>![Windows Key](img/winkey.png)</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> to open *Run Dialog*.

It should look something like this:

![run dialog](img/run_dialog.PNG)

- Enter `%UserProfile%` to open your user directory. It should look something like this:

![user dir](img/user_dir.png)

When you open your user directory, go to `View`, check the `Hidden items` checkbox, and look for `.wslconfig` file. If you do not see this file (i.e. if this was your first time opening user directory), make a new `.wslconfig` file.

Once you have a `.wslconfig`, open this file with a text editor of your choice and write following code snippet:

``` bash
[wsl2]
memory=4GB
guiApplications=false
```

*Some important notes regarding `.wslconfig`:*
- Memory limit doesn't necessary have to be 4GB. You may adjust them based on your hardware specification.
- You may need to restart your WSL2. One way to do this is by running `wsl --shutdown` command on Powershell. Once it's shutdown, reopen WSL2.
    - To open a powershell, type in `powershell` in run dialog.


To monitor your resource usage, open Task Manager with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>Esc</kbd> and look for `vmmem`. If `vmmem` is taking up memory, you may want to shutdown WSL.

Your task manager should look something like this:

![task manager](img/task_mngr.PNG)

For reference, your computer may slow down when 80% of your memory is being used.


## (If Using MacOS) Create a Case-Sensitive Disc Image
---

**Note: Some of the sample image uses 'unavco', but use 'geos627' instead.*

- Open `Disc Utility`

    ![Disk Utility](img/disc_utility.png)

- Create a blank image
    - Select `File -> New Image -> Blank Image...`
    
  ![blank image](img/blank_image.png)
  
    - Fill out the image details
        - `Save As`
            - name of the `.dmg` file the image will be saved to (unavco)
        - `Where`
            - directory where `.dmg` will be saved (wherever you like)
        - `Name`
            - name of the image itself (geos627)
        - `Size`
            - amount of space available on the image (should be large enough to hold your environment and data)
        - `Format`
            - `APFS (Case-sensitive)`
        - Leave remaining fields set to their default values
    - Click the `Save` button
    
    ![create image](img/create_image.png)
 
- Open a terminal
  - change directories into your mounted volume (created from your new disc image)
    - `cd /Volumes/geos627`
  - confirm case-sensitivity by creating two directories or files whose name differ only in capitalization
    - `mkdir a`
    - `mkdir A`
    - if you are able to create both files or directories, the file system is case-sensitive

#### **Troubleshooting for MacOS**
- If you encounter a permission error, you may have to give full disk access to your terminal and Docker system file. For more information, refer to [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58479686/permissionerror-errno-1-operation-not-permitted-after-macos-catalina-update/59250494#59250494).


## Install Docker

- Create an SSH key
    - If you previously installed git outside of WSL 2, you may need to generate a new ssh key

- Register your SSH key with GitHub
    - If using WSL 2 on Windows, note that your SSH keys will be stored in `/home//.ssh/`
    - [Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)


## Clone the Git Repository to Your Computer
---
- If you are using Windows:
    - Open WSL2 terminal
    - Move to your Linux home directory using `cd ~/`
- Once you are in Linux side of WSL, run `git clone git@github.com:ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker.git` to clone the repo using ssh or `git clone https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker.git` to clone it using https.

- If you are using Mac OSX:
    - In a terminal, move to the case-sensitive volume you created using the instructions above
    - run `git clone git@github.com:ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker.git` to clone the repo using shh or `https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker.git` to clone it using https.

- If you are using Ubuntu:
    - Open your terminal
    - run `git clone git@github.com:ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker.git` to clone the repo using ssh or `https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker.git` to clone it using https.


## Change into a Directory Holding `Makefile`
---
`Makefile` is a script that will start up the geos627 environment. Since this script is in a root directory, you can run the following commands on your terminal to start the container:

```bash
make
```

If you wish to clean your directory, you can use:
```bash
make clean
```
to remove files and directories that was genereted.

**Notes on Running Container**
In some instances, your Jupyter notebook may trigger error regarding to `permission denied`. If you happen to come across this error, try adding permission `home` directory located in this repository. To do so, you can do something like:

```bash
# note: use 777 as a last resourt.
sudo chmod -R 766 home 
```
or 

```bash
sudo chown -R home
```
to add permission. 

*For `chmod`, refer to [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-permission.htm) tutorial on what the numbers indicate. Typically, 666, 766, and 777 should work, but it may be worthwhile to understand what these numbers represent if you're concerned about security of this container.
